 * This is the function that you should implement.
 * This function needs to compute by how much the link angles should change
 * so that the robot makes a small move toward the goal while avoiding
 * obstacles, as guided by the potential field.
 *
 * allLinksDeltaTheta(j) should contain the small delta change for the angle
 * associated with the j-th link.
 *
 * Note that the attractive potential should be defined only between the end
 * effector point on the manipulator and the goal center. 
 *
 * The repulsive potential on the other hand should be defined between each
 * obstacle and each link end.
 *
 * This will ensure that, when possible, the end effector moves toward the
 * goal while every link avoids collisions with obstacles.
 *
 * You have access to the simulator.
 * You can use the methods available in simulator to get all the information
 * you need to correctly implement this function
