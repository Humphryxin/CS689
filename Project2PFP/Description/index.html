<P>Environment consists of a robot, a goal region represented as a
circle, and several obstacles represented as circles as well.
Graphical interface supports the dynamic addition and displacement of
obstacles and goal. A new obstacle can be added at any time by
pressing down the left-button of the mouse. Each obstacle and the
goal can be moved around by clicking inside them and holding the
left-button down while moving the mouse. To run the planner, user
needs to press the key 'p' on the keyboard. Pressing 'p' again
toggles between running and stopping the planner. User can change the
radius of each obstacle and the goal by first pressing the key 'r'
and then clicking inside an obstacle/goal, holding the left-button
down while moving the mouse. Pressing 'r' again toggles between
editing radius or moving the obstacles and the goal.

<P>Simulator provides access to goal center, goal radius, number of
obstacles, current robot configuration (robot x, robot y, robot
theta), and vertices of the polygon representing the robot. Simulator
also computes the closest point on the i-th obstacle for any given
point (x, y), see function <B>ClosestPointOnObstacle</B> 
</P>
<P>When computing the potential, it is recommended that you use each
vertex of the polygon robot as a control point.

<P>If using <B>C++</B> support code, you should implement the
function <B>ConfigurationMove</B> in the class <B>RigidBodyPlanner.</B>
This function should return <B>RigidBodyMove</B>, which represents a
small move (dx, dy, dtheta) by the robot. If using <B>Matlab</B>
support code, you should implement the function <B>RigidBodyPlanner</B>.

Manipulator Chain</H2>
<P>Environment consists of a 2d manipulator chain, a goal region
represented as a circle, and several obstacles represented as circles
as well. 
</P>
<P>Simulator provides access to goal center, goal radius, number of
obstacles, and start and end positions of each link in the chain.
Simulator also computes the closest point on the i-th obstacle for
any given point (x, y), see function <B>ClosestPointOnObstacle</B>
Moreover, simulator also implements Forward Kinematics, see function
<B>FK</B>. 
</P>
<P>When computing the potential, it is recommended that you use the
end position of each chain link as a control point. You should follow
a similar approach as in the case of rigid bodies. One difference is
that in the case of the manipulator chain, the attractive potential
should be computed only between the end effector (last point in the
chain) and the goal and not between any intermediate links and the
goal. In this way, the potential will guide the end effector and not
the intermediate links toward the goal. The repulsive potential, as
in the case of rigid bodies, should be computed between the end of
each link and each obstacle. 
</P>
<P><B>Important:</B> You can use an equivalent but easier to compute
definition of the Jacobian. In this definition the partial derivative
of the forward kinematics of the end position of the j-th joint with
respect to the i-th joint angle with i &lt;= j is given as

</UL>
<P>If using <B>C++</B> support code, you should implement the
function <B>ConfigurationMove</B> in the class <B>ManipPlanner.</B>
This function should compute small moves for each link angle. If

<B>ManipPlanner</B>.
